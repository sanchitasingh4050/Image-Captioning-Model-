## Image Captioning Project

This project involves a Deep Learning model that takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption for it. The model utilizes the ResNet-50 architecture to extract feature vectors from images.

## Steps

1. Data Collection
2. Understanding the data
3. Data Cleaning
4. Loading the training set
5. Data Preprocessing of Images
6. Data Preprocessing of Captions
7. Data Preparation using Generator Function
8. Word Embeddings
9. Model Architecture
10. Inference
11. Evaluation

## Dataset

The project uses the Flikr8k dataset for training and evaluation.
